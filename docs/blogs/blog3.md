# Building Trust
## in reply to Privacy in Contact Tracing Apps

I really enjoyed Tony’s blog post highlighting the importance of responsible innovation using the example of the NHS COVID-19 contact tracing app. Lyel’s lecture really emphasized that concept of responsible programming, and I think a big part of that is building trust with your users, especially when your app is in a field such as healthcare since it might have to handle sensitive information. I thought it might be a good idea to discuss ways in which an app like the NHS contact tracing app might build trust with their users, in addition to their switch from a centralized data model to a decentralized one.

One good way designers can do this is something that we touched on earlier in this class, and that’s user prototype testing or user involvement in the design process. Engaging users as active participants early in the design process can really help to enhance the design of an app like this. By crowdsourcing feedback in this manner, it helps the app begin to develop public trust early in the process, as well as allows user concerns to come up prior to release so that they can be fixed early on.

Another way designers could garner trust from users is by being fully transparent in their data handling. This could easily bolster trust. For example, after switching to the decentralized model, if developers communicated to users exactly how their data is being collected, stored, and utilized, this would demystify the technology for users and potentially alleviate any privacy concerns they might have had.

Cases such as this one should serve to remind developers of the significance of responsible innovation and building trust in your users.
