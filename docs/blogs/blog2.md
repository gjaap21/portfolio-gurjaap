# A More Positive Note 
## in reply to Learning from Mistakes

I really enjoyed Matthew‚Äôs blog about major apps messing up in big ways. Makes them more relatable for sure. I found it really interesting how most of these mistakes are just user interface related. I saw a pretty good solution to that problem in my internship last summer. Anytime the team was making a big change to the interface or adding a new feature, they would roll it out in stages, so as to get user feedback before fully launching the change. For example, they might send it out to a smaller group of 100 people, before going to 1000, before going all out if things go well. I thought that was a really effective way of getting feedback prior to a big change.

Also, I just wrote a spooky blog post about bugs, so I thought I would respond to this one on a more positive note and provide an example of a well-detailed design process resulting in a successful implementation, in contrast to the failures in Matthew‚Äôs blog post. In the same internship, I was forced to create a detailed design document before I was allowed to write any code and work on my project üôÅ. At first, I hated this because it took so much effort to think about how the project should actually be structured and how things would come together, and I thought it would‚Äôve been easier to just dive in and figure it out. However, after a grueling few weeks where I would turn in my design document, and everyone would then review it and offer ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù that I had to address and then resubmit, I was finally ready to start, and I honestly felt so prepared. The actual coding part went fairly smoothly (as smooth as coding can go at least) since I had a really organized structure to follow. I got errors all the time, but they wouldn‚Äôt be because of any structural issues, so that‚Äôs a win. I think this really highlights the importance of developing a good idea of the structure of your project before diving in, as I don‚Äôt think things would‚Äôve gone very well if I hadn‚Äôt.
