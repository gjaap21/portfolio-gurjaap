# Assignment 6: User Testing and Analysis
31 October 2024

## Task List
| Title | Instruction | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unblur Post | Use the blurring feature to see if one of the blurred posts is appropriate or not | The goal of this task is to see if users will use the feature in the way that it was intended, which was to slowly unblur the post so that you can try to tell if it’s inappropriate before fully unblurring it (I put this one first because I wasn’t able to finish with the filters, so I just manually blurred some posts before giving control to the user) |
| Filter User | Add the user named gurjaap to your list of filtered users | The goal of this task is to see if users will know where to look for this feature |
| Report Post | Report a post from user gurjaap | The goal of this task is to hear a user’s thoughts on the reporting interface |
| Validate Report | Validate the report that you just made from an admin account | The goal of this task is to see how intuitive/easy it is for an admin to find and address reports |
| Badge of Shame | Check to see if the reported user, gurjaap, received a badge of shame on their profile | The goal of this task is to see what users think of the badging concept and to ask their thoughts on whether it would be an effective countermeasure |

## Participant Report 1
This participant was a 12 year old girl who has some experience with social media platforms already. She fits into the intended demographic of Safespace.

One slightly negative moment was that when she was first told to unblur a post, she just moved the slider all the way to 0 and didn’t slowly unblur it. However, without any prompting, she did start playing with it a little bit, and it seemed like she realized that she could slowly unblur it instead. When asked later if she thought she would use the slow unblurring after realizing that she could do it, she said that she would.

Another slightly negative moment was when she was trying to filter a user. She first went to the user’s profile and didn’t see an option for it. However, she did click the button labeled settings at the top after this and was able to find it fairly quickly. When asked afterwards, she said that she would usually go to the user’s profile to block them on Tiktok, so she thought it would be there. This would make sense to add since it would make Safespace more consistent with other apps which is something we discussed earlier in the course.

A positive moment was when she was reporting a post. It was really easy for her to figure out how to do it, and I think she liked the checkbox options that were available since she checked them all lol. 

A negative moment was when she was trying to validate a report as an admin. She didn’t realize that the Report label was a button that would allow her to see all of the reports for a little while. She did try clicking on it eventually, but only after looking around for a little bit. I asked her about this later, and she said that she didn’t even really notice it at first, and then when she did, she wasn’t sure if it was a button. However, actually validating the reports was pretty easy for her.

A slightly positive moment was with the badge of shame. She saw it immediately and thought it was funny. I asked her thoughts about it, and she said she wouldn’t want that on her profile, which is what we were hoping for.

## Participant Report 2
This participant was a 22 year old man who has a lot of experience with social media platforms. He isn’t necessarily the intended user demographic, but I think he is the expected admin demographic, so I thought it would be useful to study him as well, to learn about the admin interface. 

One positive moment I noticed was when this participant was unblurring one of the posts, he was able to tell what it was while he slowly reduced the blurring. I asked him how he knew to slowly reduce the blurring and not just drag it all the way down to 0 immediately, and he said the slider made it seem like that’s what he was supposed to do, which is what we wanted to happen.

One negative moment was when this participant was trying to filter a user. It took him a while to find where it was. He first went to the user’s profile and looked around there, but there wasn’t anything. After that, he went to his own profile and clicked on the settings wheel and found it there. At this point, he also questioned why there was a settings wheel and also a settings labeled button at the top and what the difference was between them. I asked him about both of these things later. He said he expected to see some type of options menu or drop down list type of thing where he would’ve been able to add the user to his filter list, which does make sense. As for the double settings options, it’s understandable why he would be confused by it since they do the same thing. The settings wheel only appears on your own profile while the settings button is always visible, but it could be a good idea to get rid of one.

Another positive moment was that he really liked the report interface. During the actual study, he noted that the report menu had a lot of options, and when asked afterwards, he said it was really easy to navigate the report system and submit a report. He also thought validating the reports was pretty intuitive and easy to find as it was just an obvious button on the home screen.

A slightly negative moment was that he was able to easily see the badge of shame, but he thought it would be more effective if it was bigger or made some kind of effect go across the screen. He thought it would be pretty easy to just ignore it if you got the badge.

## Opportunities for Improvement
- One opportunity is providing a way for a user to add another user into their filtered list directly from that user’s profile. This is currently an issue because the only way to add a user to the filtered list is in the settings menu, and it was brought up in both of the studies. This would be a conceptual moderate error since the user’s mental model would include the ability to filter a user from their profile, and it would be fairly annoying for the user to encounter this issue all the time. A couple good solutions for this could be a button that appears on their profile that just adds them to the filter list or some kind of drop down that includes the options to maybe add the user and also remove the user from the filter list.
- Another opportunity is making it easier for the admin to know how to view the reports. This is currently an issue because the toggle to swap between Posts and Reports is not perfectly obvious. It can be unclear that they are buttons and not just labels, and this was brought up in one of the studies. This would be a linguistic issue since the user isn’t aware that they are buttons, and it would be a fairly minor one since users can still find the reports eventually but there would be some unnecessary friction. A good solution could be to make the labels more “button-like” and maybe add a box around them that highlights the currently selected one.
- A third opportunity would be to make the badge of shame more impactful on a user’s profile. This is currently an issue because although it is noticeable, it can be ignored fairly easily. This was brought up in one of the studies. This would probably be another minor linguistic error since it doesn’t affect functionality and can be fixed via the interface. A few good solutions for this could be to just make it much bigger, make it change the color of the background of a user’s profile, or maybe have some kind of effect appear across the screen when the profile is first opened.
- Another opportunity would be to fix the filtering code. This is currently an issue because it doesn’t work for blurring filtered users as of right now. For the studies, I had to manually blur some posts before giving control to the participants, and the older participant did notice that when he went back to the home page later, that the posts weren’t blurred anymore. This would be a critical conceptual error since it affects functionality greatly and doesn’t match the user’s mental model of what adding a user to the filtered list should do. This can be fixed by resolving some issues in the filtering code.
